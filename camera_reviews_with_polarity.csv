nothing phone (2),"Phone is really good. Really snappy. Each and every app loads very fast. Memory management is good. Design is also good but glyph is really a gimmick. Didn't use it till now.Display is very bright and clear. LTPO works like charm and saves battery. Battery backup and standby is good because of that.Camera is just average. Haptics could have better.

nothing phone (2),"The back seems like plastic a bit. But when compared to pixel 7 I think it's more better. This is not for photography people but doesn't mean camera isn't great but it's just that not as cool as it is in other rivals. The 120hz refresh rate is fire. The phone is quite big and the smooth OS. The back lights truly are psych. More over, ip54 is bit of a compromise. But likewise pick any phone we got to compromise on something eventually.
