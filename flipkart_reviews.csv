pixel 8a,"1. The camera captures great details, but other competing phones even 1-2 year old out performs it (tried moon photo, night astrophotography, old orange bulb, trees with sky). Could not impress anyone with the cameras. Tried comparing with iphone 14, and other motorola and xiaomi phones of similar price range from 1-2 years ago.2. Charging speed is extremely slow and this doesn't support a lot of charging adapters and cables. One has to properly find perfect cable and adapter permutation to ...READ MORE"
pixel 8a,"This phone is a winner in terms of software, camera, design, and build quality. It boasts a premium look and feel, and the software delivers a fantastic user experience.

The bezels are definitely thick, but this does not seem to bother me at all, and i hardly notice it, its not that of an issue as some people says it is. Price is high for Indian pockets, and you need to be a real fan of Google Pixel to own it in India due to the price. It no longer has that heating issue faced in 7a,...READ MORE"
pixel 8a,"I  switched from the pixel 4a to the pixel 8a. After using it for a day, I didn't notice many differences between the two phones except for the size. The phone itself is good, but I do feel that it is a bit overpriced. When I charged the phone in the air-conditioned room, I noticed that it charged rapidly.READ MORE"
pixel 8a,Had pixel 4a earlier and was pretty satisfied it with overall...not a game guy but used to play pubg whenever I wanted to play and gave me a decent performance though....bought pixel 8a and it's been weeks using this phone and I can say it is one of the best experience using Android...go for itREAD MORE

Exchange my old moto phone (bought at 13k, exchanged it for 12k).Stunning phone from Google. Camera is excellent! Battery even though a bit on the lower side, it lasts comfortably for more than one day for moderate users. Also no heating and network issues observed. Software is light and crisp as ever.READ MORE"
pixel 8a,The Phone for a pixel is very good. The only issue is the slow charging full charge may take ages. Nothing less than 3 hours or more. Everything else is good. If you want a full charge in the morning when you start your day you need to charge full nightREAD MORE
pixel 8a,"Camera captures great, however in low light it's not upto mark overall good.

I have not faced any heating issues post the initial few days. overall very happy with the buyREAD MORE"
